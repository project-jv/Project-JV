PROJECT JV
A PLUGGABLE, DOMAIN-EXPERT AI ASSISTANT

Project JV, concepualized and managed by Kiko Serna, is a project to develop
an artifical-intelligence enhanced, domain-expert computer assistant.  The
goal is also to make all core functionality platform-independent so that
Project JV can be ported to any OS supporting the implementation language.

Project JV is being developed on Windows using Cygwin, Netbeans, and the
Gnu toolchain.  Microsoft Visual Studio is being used to implement OS-
specific functionalty such as speech input and speech output.
